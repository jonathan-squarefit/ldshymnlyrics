O thou kind and gracious Father,
Reigning in the heavâ€™ns above,
Look on us, thy humble children;
Fill us with thy holy love.
Fill us with thy holy love. ###
We have met this Sabbath morning,
Words of life and truth to hear.
Teach us how to ever serve thee
And thy holy name revere,
And thy holy name revere. ###
Help us to resist temptation;
Help us to refrain from ill.
Help us all to gain salvation;
Help us all to do thy will.
Help us all to do thy will. ###
