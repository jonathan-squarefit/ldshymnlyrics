Father in Heaven, in thy love abounding,
Hear these thy children thru the world resounding,
Loud in thy praises. Thanks for peace abiding,
Ever abiding. ###
Filled be our hearts with peace beyond comparing,
Peace in thy world, and joy to hearts despairing.
Firm is our trust in thee for peace enduring,
Ever enduring. ###
God of our fathers, strengthen evâ€™ry nation
In thy great peace, where only is salvation.
So may the world its future spread before thee,
Thus to adore thee. ###
