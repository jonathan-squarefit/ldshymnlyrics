Upon the cross of Calvary
They crucified our Lord
And sealed with blood the sacrifice
That sanctified his word. ###
Upon the cross he meekly died
For all mankind to see
That death unlocks the passageway
Into eternity. ###
Upon the cross our Savior died,
But, dying, brought new birth
Through resurrectionâ€™s miracle
To all the sons of earth. ###
