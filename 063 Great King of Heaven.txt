Great King of heav’n, our hearts we raise
To thee in prayer, to thee in praise.
The vales exult, the hills acclaim,
And all thy works revere thy name. ###
O Israel’s God! Thine arm is strong.
To thee all earth and skies belong,
And with one voice in one glad chord,
With myriad echoes, praise the Lord. ###
