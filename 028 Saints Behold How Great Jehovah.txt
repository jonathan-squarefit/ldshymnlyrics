Saints, behold how great Jehovah
Hath his blessings on you shed.
Zion ev’rywhere is growing
As the gospel light is spread! ###
Out of all past dispensations,
God is bringing into one
Ev’ry truth by prophets spoken,
For the last days have begun. ###
Rise and lift up Zion’s standard;
Tell our Father’s children now:
Heaven’s blessed King approaches;
All men must before him bow. ###x
