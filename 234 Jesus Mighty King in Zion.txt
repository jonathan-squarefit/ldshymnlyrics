Jesus, mighty King in Zion,
Thou alone our guide shalt be.
Thy commission we rely on;
We will follow none but thee. ###
As an emblem of thy passion
And thy vict’ry o’er the grave,
We, who know thy great salvation,
Are baptized beneath the wave. ###
Fearless of the world’s despising,
We the ancient path pursue,
Buried with the Lord and rising
To a life divinely new. ###
