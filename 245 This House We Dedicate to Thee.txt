This house we dedicate to thee,
Our God, our fathersâ€™ God.
Wilt thou accept and deign to bless
The path our feet have trod? ###
Wilt thou thy servants here inspire
When in thy name they speak?
And wilt thou bless each contrite soul
Who here thy face doth seek? ###
Here may our sons and daughters come
And find that peace which swells
From grateful hearts, when touched by thee,
Wherein thy Spirit dwells! ###
