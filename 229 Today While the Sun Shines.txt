The peace and the joy that are found in the fold.

While here we labor, choose the better part.

Today, today, your duties fulfill.
Today, today, work while you may;
Prepare for tomorrow by working today. ###

As crown of your life and the grace of your youth.

Constant and faithful all the way through.
Today, today, work with a will;
Today, today, your duties fulfill.
Today, today, work while you may;
Prepare for tomorrow by working today. ###
