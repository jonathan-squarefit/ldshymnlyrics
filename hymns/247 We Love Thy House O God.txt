We love thy house, O God,
Wherein thine honor dwells.
The joy of thine abode
All earthly joy excels. ###
It is the house of prayer,
Wherein thy servants meet,
And thou, O Lord, art there,
Thy chosen flock to greet. ###
We love the word of life,
The word that tells of peace,
Of comfort in the strife,
Of joys that never cease. ###
