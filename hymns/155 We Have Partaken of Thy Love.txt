We have partaken of thy love,
O Lord, this sacred hour;
We have renewed our covenants
And felt thy cleansing pow’r,
And felt thy cleansing pow’r. ###
Let us go forth refreshed, resolved
To serve our fellowmen,
Forgive our neighbors, live thy word,
Until we come again,
Until we come again. ###
Raising to thee in song and word
Our praise, most holy One,
We ask thy benediction, Lord,
Thru thy Beloved Son,
Thru thy Beloved Son. ###
