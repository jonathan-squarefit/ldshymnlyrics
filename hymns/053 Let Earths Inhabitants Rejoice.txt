Let earth’s inhabitants rejoice
And gladly hail the glorious hour;
Again is heard a prophet’s voice,
And all may feel the gospel’s pow’r. ###
The blissful time will soon arrive,
The day by holy men foretold,
When man no more with man will strive,
And all in each a friend behold. ###
Oppression will no more be found,
Nor tyrant hold relentless sway,
But love to God and man abound
Thruout the long millennial day. ###
