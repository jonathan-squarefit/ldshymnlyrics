That Easter morn, a grave that burst
Proclaimed to man that “Last and First”
Had ris’n again
And conquered pain. ###
This morn renews for us that day
When Jesus cast the bonds away,
Took living breath
And conquered death. ###
Thus we in gratitude recall
And give our love and pledge our all,
Shed grateful tear
And conquer fear. ###
