There is a green hill far away,
Without a city wall,
Where the dear Lord was crucified,
Who died to save us all. ###
We may not know, we cannot tell,
What pains he had to bear,
But we believe it was for us
He hung and suffered there. ###
There was no other good enough
To pay the price of sin.
He only could unlock the gate
Of heavâ€™n and let us in. ###
Oh, dearly, dearly has he loved!
And we must love him too,
And trust in his redeeming blood,
And try his works to do.
