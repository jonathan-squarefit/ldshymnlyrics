Thy servants are prepared
To teach thy word abroad,
To gather in thy sheep
To thee, O Lamb of God. ###
Let these, thy servants, speak
With heart and voice of youth,
And fill the world’s dark lamps
With light, the flame of truth. ###
In all of Zion’s stakes
Thy love shall conquer night,
While darkness draws away
From thy revealing light. ###
