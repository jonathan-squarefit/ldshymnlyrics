Great God, to thee my evening song
With humble gratitude I raise;
Oh, let thy mercy tune my tongue
And fill my heart with lively praise. ###
My days, unclouded as they pass,
And ev’ry onward rolling hour
Are monuments of wondrous grace
And witness to thy love and pow’r. ###
With hope in thee mine eyelids close;
With sleep refresh my feeble frame.
Safe in thy care may I repose
And wake with praises to thy name. ###
