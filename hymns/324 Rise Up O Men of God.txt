Rise up, O men of God!
Have done with lesser things.
Give heart and soul and mind and strength
To serve the King of Kings. ###
Rise up, O men of God,
In one united throng.
Bring in the day of brotherhood
And end the night of wrong. ###
Rise up, O men of God!
Tread where his feet have trod.
As brothers of the Son of Man,
Rise up, O men of God! ###
