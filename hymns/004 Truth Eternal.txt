Truth eternal, truth divine,
In thine ancient fulness shine!
Burst the fetters of the mind
From the millions of mankind! ###
Truth again restored to earth,
Opened with a prophet’s birth.
Priests of heaven’s royal line
Bear the keys of truth divine! ###
Truth shall triumph as the light
Chases far the misty night.
Endless ages own its sway,
Clad in everlasting day. ###
