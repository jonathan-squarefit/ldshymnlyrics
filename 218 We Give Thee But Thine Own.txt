We give thee but thine own,
Whate’er the gift may be,
For all we have is thine alone,
A trust, O Lord, from thee. ###
May we thy bounties thus
As stewards true receive,
And gladly, as thou blessest us,
To thee our firstfruits give. ###
To comfort and to bless,
To find a balm for woe,
To tend the lone and fatherless
Is angels’ work below. ###
And we believe thy word,
Tho dim our faith may be;
Whate’er we do for thine, O Lord,
We do it unto thee. ###
