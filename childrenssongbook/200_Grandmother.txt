You give me a kiss.
You give me a hug.
You smile when you see me too.
I wish ev’ry child in the whole wide world
Had a grandmother* just like you. ###
You read me a book.
You sing me a song.
You whisper you love me too.
I wish ev’ry child in the whole wide world
Had a grandmother* just like you. ###
I’ll try to be good;
I’ll do as I should.
I’ll whisper, “I love you too.”
I wish ev’ry child in the whole wide world
Had a grandmother* just like you. ###
