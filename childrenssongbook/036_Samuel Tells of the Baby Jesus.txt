Said Samuel, “Within five years
A night will be as day,
And Baby Jesus will be born
In a land far, far away.”
Hosanna! Hosanna!
Oh, let us gladly sing.
How blessed that our Lord was born;
Let earth receive her King! ###
Across the sea, in Bethlehem,
Lord Jesus came to earth
As Samuel had prophesied,
And angels sang His birth.
Hosanna! Hosanna!
Oh, let us gladly sing.
How blessed that our Lord was born;
Let earth receive her King! ###
