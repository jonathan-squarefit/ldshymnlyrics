Ducks in the pond quack a happy song.
Mother hens cackle the whole day long.
Birds in their nests and wind in the treetops
All join in singing a happy song. ###
Children are singing a happy song,
Singing together the whole day long.
Don’t mind the weather; let’s sing together,
All join in singing a happy song. ###
