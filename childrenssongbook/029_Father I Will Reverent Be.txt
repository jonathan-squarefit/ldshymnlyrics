Father, I will rev’rent be
And in thy house walk quietly;
Fold my arms and bow my head
And close my eyes when prayers are said;
Listen to the words I hear,
For in thy house I feel thee near.
May my thoughts more perfect be,
That I may speak more rev’rently.
Father, I will rev’rent be
And in thy house walk quietly. ###
