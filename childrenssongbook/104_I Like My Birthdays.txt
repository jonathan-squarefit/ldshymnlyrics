I like my birthdays, ev’ry one;
Each brings a greater joy to me.
But I can’t wait until I’m eight,
For then I’ll be baptized, you see. ###
To be baptized as Jesus was
By one who holds the priesthood true
And thus obey God’s holy laws
Is just the thing I want to do. ###
When hands are laid upon my head,
Then I’ll receive the Holy Ghost.
And, if I listen carefully,
I’ll have the blessing I need most. ###
