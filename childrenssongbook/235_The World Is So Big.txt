The world is so big and, oh, so round,
And in it God’s creations are found;
Mountains and valleys and trees so tall,
Animals big and animals small.
The world is so big and, oh, so round.
God loves us all; our blessings abound. ###
The world is so big and, oh, so round,
And in it God’s creations are found;
Stars shining brightly through all the night,
Sun in the day so warm and so bright.
The world is so big and, oh, so round.
God loves us all; our blessings abound. ###
