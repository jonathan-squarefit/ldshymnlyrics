Have a very happy birthday
Filled with sunshine ev’rywhere!
May the year bring joy and gladness
And the love of friends who care. ###
Have a most exciting birthday!
Share a smile with someone new.
Say a kind word to your neighbor;
Let him know a happy you. ###
Have a very special birthday!
Add a candle, blow it out,
Share your cake, and share your friendship;
That’s what birthdays are about. ###
