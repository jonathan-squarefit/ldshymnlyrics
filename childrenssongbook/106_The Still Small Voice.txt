Through a still small voice, the Spirit speaks to me
To guide me, to save me from the evil I may see.
If I try to do whatâ€™s right, he will lead me thru the night,
Direct me, protect me, and give my soul his light.
Listen, listen. The Holy Ghost will whisper.
Listen, listen to the still small voice. ###
