The Lord gave me a temple to live within on earth.
Once in Heaven I was spirit, but I left my home at birth.
I’ll make my temple brighter; I’ll keep my spirit free.
My body is the temple my Father gave to me. ###
If I keep my body clean and pure and habit-free,
I may in Father’s temple claim blessings promised me.
On resurrection morning, I’ll take my body bright
And in celestial glory forever live in light. ###
