Before I take the sacrament, I sit so quietly.
I know that Jesus came to earth and died for me. ###
I think of all the boys and girls whom Jesus used to know,
The days he walked upon the earth, so long ago. ###
I take the water and the bread and try so hard to be
The kind of child that Jesus loved in Galilee. ###
