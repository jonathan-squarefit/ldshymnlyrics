Mother dear, I love you so.
Your happy, smiling face
Is such a joy to look at;
It makes home a lovely place. ###
Mother dear, I love you so.
Your lovely, shining eyes
Are just like stars that twinkle
Way up in the bright blue skies. ###
Mother dear, I love you so.
I’ll try the whole day through
To please our Heav’nly Father.
I’m so glad he gave me you. ###
