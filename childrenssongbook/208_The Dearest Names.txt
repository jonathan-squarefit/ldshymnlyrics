I know a name, a glorious name,
Dearer than any other.
Listen, I’ll whisper the name to you:
It is the name of mother.
Mother, so tender and kind and true,
I love you, I love you.
Mother, so tender and kind and true,
I love you. ###
I know a name, a glorious name,
Dearer than any other.
Listen, I’ll whisper the name to you:
It is the name of father.
Father, so noble and brave and true,
I love you, I love you.
Father, so noble and brave and true,
I love you. ###
