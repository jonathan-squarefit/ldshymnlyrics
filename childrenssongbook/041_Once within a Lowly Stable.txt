Once within a lowly stable,
Where the sheep and oxen lay,
A loving mother laid her baby
In a manger filled with hay.
Mary was the mother there,
And the Christ that baby fair. ###
God sent us this loving baby
From his home in heavâ€™n above,
And he came down to show all people
How to help and how to love.
This is why the angels bright
Sang for joy that Christmas night. ###
