Thou shalt have no gods but Me.
Before no idols bow thy knee.
Take not the name of God in vain.
Do not the Sabbath day profane.
Honor thy parents all thy days.
Take not life in wanton ways.
Be faithful in thy marriage trust.
And never steal or be unjust.
Always tell the truth-and love it.
What is thy neighborâ€™s, do not covet.
And the greatest commandments of all:
With all thy heart, love God above;
And as thyself thy neighbor love. ###
