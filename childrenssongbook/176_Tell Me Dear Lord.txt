Tell me, dear Lord, in thine own way I pray,
What thou would’st have me say and do today.
Teach me to know and love thy will, O Lord;
Help me to understand thy loving word. ###
I would be guided by thy loving hand;
Would hear thy voice, obey thy blest command.
Each moment just to know that thou art near
Will strength impart and banish ev’ry fear. ###
