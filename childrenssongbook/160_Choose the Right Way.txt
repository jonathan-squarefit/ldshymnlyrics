There’s a right way to live and be happy;
It is choosing the right ev’ry day.
I am learning the teachings of Jesus;
They will help me and show me the way.
Choose the right way and be happy.
I must always choose the right. ###
Through the gospel I learn to be prayerful,
To have faith, to repent, to obey,
And I know if I live by his teachings,
I will truly be happy each day.
Choose the right way and be happy.
I must always choose the right. ###
