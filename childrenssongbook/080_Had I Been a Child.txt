Had I been a child when Jesus came
Unto the Nephites that blessed day
And showed them the wounds in his hands and his feet
And knelt with them to pray. ###
Then he might have held me safe in his arms;
He might have looked in my eyes and said
A word, with his blessing of kindness and love,
His hands placed upon my head. ###
Someday, when the Savior comes again,
Oh, how I hope that my heart will be
As pure as the hearts of the children that day
Who gathered around his knee. ###
