Fair is the sunshine,
Fairer the moonlight
And all the stars in heavâ€™n above;
Jesus shines brighter,
Jesus shines purer
And brings to all the world his love. ###
Fair are the meadows,
Fairer the woodlands,
Robed in the flowers of blooming spring;
Jesus is fairer,
Jesus is purer.
He makes the sorrowing spirit sing. ###
Beautiful Savior!
Lord of the nations!
Son of God and Son of Man!
Thee will I honor, praise, and give glory,
Give praise and glory evermore!
Evermore! ###
