I believe in being honest;
I believe in being true,
That honesty should start with me
In all I say, in all I do.
Iâ€™ll form good habits in my youth,
To keep my word, to tell the truth,
To speak up in defending right
And keep my name and honor bright.
I believe in being honest;
I believe in being true,
That honesty should start with me
In all I say, in all I do. ###
