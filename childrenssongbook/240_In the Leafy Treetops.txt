In the leafy treetops, the birds sing “Good morning.”
They’re first to see the sun.
They must tell ev’ryone.
In the leafy treetops, the birds sing “Good morning.” ###
In my pretty garden, the flowers are nodding.
“How do you do?” they say.
“How do you do today?”
In my pretty garden, the flowers are nodding. ###
