I know you, and you know me.
We are as diff’rent as the sun and the sea.
I know you, and you know me,
And that’s the way it’s supposed to be. ###
I help you, and you help me.
We learn from problems, and we’re starting to see.
I help you, and you help me,
And that’s the way it’s supposed to be. ###
I love you, and you love me.
We reach together for the best we can be.
I love you, and you love me,
And that’s the way it’s supposed to be. ###
