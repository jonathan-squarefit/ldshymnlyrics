The hearts of the children have turned to their fathers,
Have turned, have turned, have turned,
Because of the truth they have learned from Elijah,
Have learned, have learned, have learned.
And we as the children can seek out our loved ones,
Preserving their names and their memory.
We can strive to be worthy to kneel in the temple
And bind them to us for eternity.
The hearts of the children have turned to their fathers,
Have turned, have turned, have turned. ###
