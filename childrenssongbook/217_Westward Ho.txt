Over the winding trail forward we go.
Westward ho, Westward ho!
The dangers are many; the wagons are slow.
Westward ho, Westward ho! ###
Often weâ€™re weary and laden with woe.
Westward ho, Westward ho!
And what we shall find ahead we do not know.
Westward ho, Westward ho! ###
Over high mountains and prairies we go.
Westward ho, Westward ho!
To lands of new promise with hearts all aglow.
Westward ho, Westward ho! ###
