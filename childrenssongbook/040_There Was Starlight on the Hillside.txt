There was starlight on the hillside,
And one star bent very low
Till it passed above a stable
On that night so long ago. ###
There were shepherds on the hillside
On that night in Bethlehem.
Heavâ€™nly hosts appeared, proclaiming
Joyous tidings unto them. ###
There was Jesus in the manger,
Born that night in Bethlehem.
And the shepherds left the hillside,
And they came to worship him. ###
