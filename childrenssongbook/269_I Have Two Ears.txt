I have two ears to hear the truth,
Two eyes to see the good.
I have two feet to carry me
To places where they should.
I’ll try to use them wisely
In my work and play.
I thank my Heav’nly Father
For making me this way. ###
I have two lips to speak kind words,
Two hands to work for me.
All these loving helpers
Heav’nly Father gave to me.
I’ll try to use them wisely
In my work and play.
I thank my Heav’nly Father
For making me this way. ###
