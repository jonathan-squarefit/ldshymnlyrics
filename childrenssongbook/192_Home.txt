Home is where the heart is
And warmth and love abound.
Home is where warm, circling arms
Go all the way around. ###
Home is where there’s father,
With strength and wisdom true.
Home is where there’s mother
And all the children too. ###
Home is where our Father,
Who dwells in heav’n above,
Guides us in the way we live
And lets us feel his love. ###
