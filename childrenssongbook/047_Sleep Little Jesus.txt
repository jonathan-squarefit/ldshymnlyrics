Sleep, little Jesus, Lord of the earth.
Angels are telling the news of thy birth.
Shepherds will come to thee, bringing thee love.
Bright shines the star in heaven above. ###
“Sleep, little Jesus,” softly we sing.
Earth long has waited her Savior and King.
Heavenly hosts sing, “Alleluia,
Peace to all men, Alleluia!” ###
