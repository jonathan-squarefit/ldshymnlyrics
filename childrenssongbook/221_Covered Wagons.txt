Day after day the wagons are rolling.
Onward and westward we ever must roam.
Roll along, roll along, covered wagons!
Take us safely to our new home. ###
Night after night we sit round the campfire,
Singing the songs that remind us of home.
Roll along, roll along, covered wagons!
Take us safely to our new home. ###
Someday weâ€™ll reach the land of our dreaming,
Settle and build on some land of our own.
Roll along, roll along, covered wagons!
Take us safely to our new home. ###
