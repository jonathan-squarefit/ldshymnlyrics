Jesus came to John the Baptist,
In Judea long ago,
And was baptized by immersion
In the River Jordan’s flow. ###
“To fulfill the law,” said Jesus,
When the Baptist questioned why,
“And to enter with my Father
In the kingdom up on high.” ###
Now we know that we must also
Witness faith in Jesus’ word,
Be baptized to show obedience,
As was Jesus Christ, our Lord. ###
