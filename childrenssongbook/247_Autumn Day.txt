Autumn day, autumn day,
God gives richest gifts today.
Look on evâ€™ry side and see
Pleasant things for you and me.
Apples red and apples yellow,
Round and juicy, sweet and mellow,
Load the trees till they bend over
And their branches brush the clover.
Child, be glad with all that lives,
But forget not God, who gives. ###
