This is my country! I sing it with pride
Whether it’s desert sand duned and wide,
Mountains with pine trees, land iceberg bound.
It’s here where my home and my loved ones are found. ###
This is my country, and all that I do
Should make it mighty, noble, and true.
I love my country. Long may it be
A land where my people are honest and free. ###
