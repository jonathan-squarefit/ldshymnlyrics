Let us gather in a circle
And kneel in fam’ly prayer
To thank our Heav’nly Father
For the blessings we all share. ###
Let us thank him for our mealtime,
For clothes we daily wear,
For parents, home, and fam’ly,
For his kind and loving care. ###
Oh, may we always serve him,
In thought and action too,
And humbly kneel at prayer-time
As so many fam’lies do. ###
