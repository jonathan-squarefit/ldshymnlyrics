It is fun to have a friend who will play with you.
It is fun to have a friend who can stay with you.
It is fun to make a friend for your whole life through.
But to have a friend, you must be a friend, too. ###
If you want to play a game, you should play it fair.
If you have a piece of cake, you must learn to share.
Then if you should need a friend, you would have one there.
If you want a friend, you must show that you care. ###
