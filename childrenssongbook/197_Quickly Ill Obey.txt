When my mother calls me,
Quickly I’ll obey.
I want to do just what is best
Each and ev’ry day. ###
When my father calls me,
Quickly I’ll obey.
I want to do just what is best
Each and ev’ry day. ###
Heav’nly Father loves me,
Blesses me each day.
I want to do just what is best
Each and ev’ry day. ###
