Though a boy I may appear,
Yet a man I soon will be.
If I prepare and live clean in ev’ry thought, word, and deed,
I will be worthy to hold the sacred priesthood of God.
So I now prepare myself;
I will serve my fellowmen.
Being armed with the truth, with the scriptures my guide,
I’ll go forward, a young man prepared,
I’ll go forward, a young man prepared. ###
