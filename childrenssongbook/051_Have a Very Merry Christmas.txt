Have a very merry Christmas!
Scatter gladness ev’rywhere!
Sing the carols of the Christ child:
Let your neighbors know you care. ###
Have a most exciting Christmas!
Ring a bell and trim a tree;
Stuff a stocking for a loved one;
Hang the holly joyously. ###
Have a happy fam’ly Christmas!
Gather all your loved ones near;
Talk about the baby Jesus;
Wrap your hearts in love this year. ###
