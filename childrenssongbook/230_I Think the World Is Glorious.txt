I think the world is glorious and lovely as can be.
The birds and bees and blossoms bring sweet messages to me.
I sing, and sing, and sing, and sing
A song of joy and love.
I sing, and sing, and sing, and sing
My thanks to God above. ###
I think the world is glorious and lovely as can be,
For I have teachers kind and true, and parents who love me.
I sing, and sing, and sing, and sing
A song of joy and love.
I sing, and sing, and sing, and sing
My thanks to God above. ###
