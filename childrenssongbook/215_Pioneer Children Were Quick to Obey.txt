Pioneer children were quick to obey,
Walking along by the wagons all day,
Then in the firelight, kneeling to pray,
Little pioneer children. ###
Carrying water and gathering wood,
Building a campfire and cooking the food,
Learning and helping the best that they could,
Little pioneer children. ###
Children today can be pioneers too,
Willing and cheerful in all that we do,
Walking our pathway with heaven in view,
Little pioneer children. ###
