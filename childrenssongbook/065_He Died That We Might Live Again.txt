He died that we might live again,
Lord Jesus, our Redeemer true.
He died on Calv’ry’s lonely hill.
His life he gave for me and you.
He rose from the grave on Easter morn,
Our Savior and our King.
He showed his love for all mankind.
For his great love, give thanks and sing.
Rejoice! Rejoice! and sing, sing, sing. ###
