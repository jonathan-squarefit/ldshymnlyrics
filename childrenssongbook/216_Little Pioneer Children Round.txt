① Little pioneer children gath’ring berries for food;
② See the pioneer children hunting chips for wood.
③ Gladly helping each other, merry and happy were they,
④ Walking along, moving along, on their way. ###
① Hear the pioneer children singing all the day.
② See the pioneer children; there’s still time for play.
③ Often singing and dancing, merry and happy were they,
④ Walking along, moving along, on their way. ###
