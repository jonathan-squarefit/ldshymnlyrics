Did Jesus really live again?
Yes, when the third day came,
He wakened and he left the tomb;
He called Maryâ€™s name. ###
Did Jesus come to those he loved?
Yes, people touched his feet,
And of the fish and honeycomb
He did truly eat. ###
And there were nail-prints in his hands
And a spear wound in his side.
Did Jesus really live again
After he had died?
Oh yes! And so shall I! ###
