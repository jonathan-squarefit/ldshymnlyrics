Come, we that love the Lord,
And let our joys be known.
Join in a song with sweet accord,
And worship at his throne. ###
Let those refuse to sing
Who never knew our God,
But servants of the heav’nly King
May speak their joys abroad. ###
The God who rules on high
And all the earth surveys—
Who rides upon the stormy sky
And calms the roaring seas— ###
This mighty God is ours,
Our Father and our Love.
He will send down his heav’nly pow’rs
To carry us above. ###
