God, our Father, hear us pray;
Send thy grace this holy day.
As we take of emblems blest,
On our Saviorâ€™s love we rest. ###
Grant us, Father, grace divine;
May thy smile upon us shine.
As we eat the broken bread,
Thine approval on us shed. ###
As we drink the water clear,
Let thy Spirit linger near.
Pardon faults, O Lord, we pray;
Bless our efforts day by day. ###
